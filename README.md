# Mock-Car-Rental-UI-Database

This assignment was finished in semester 2 of my degree, from approximately March to June 2020
It is a mock car rental command line UI made in cs with an SQL database to back up entries.
It uses object oriented programming to efficiently assign different values to cars, customers, and rental services.

The program includes methods to add, modify, and delete cars, customers, rental services (assigning existing customers to existing cars).
It includes methods for displaying cars, customers, and rentals in dynamic tables.

Running MRRC/program.cs displays the UI.

Controls for the UI are explained in the program.
